\section{Working Experience}
\cventry{2021.07~$\sim$Present}{Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.}{Lead Engineer}{China}{}{I transfered to Huawei Technological Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen, due to the department leader's affirmation of my preliminary work. The work is divided into two phrases. First, I continued on the architecture conformance project, where I led the research and the development of the platform that can guard the software architectures of existing software projects written in C/C++, Java. This platform has been adopted by at least three major R\&D development departments in the whole company, one of which is Hisilicon. Second, which is what I am currently working on, is the full-fledged software analysis platform, which provides a basket of solutions to the software qualitiy and development efficiency improvements. The project roots from the previous platform, where I designed the overall architecture consisted of data-model creation service, data lake service, as well as the application service. Till now, A general-purpose data model for all the major programming laguages including C/C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Rust, etc has been developed; and the Java-targeted analysis has been live, C/C++-targeted analysis is on the way.}
\cventry{2020.10~$\sim$2021.06}{Huawei International Pte Ltd}{Senior Researcher}{Singapore}{}{I joined Huawei Internation Pte. Ltd. as one of the \textbf{Huawei TopMinds}, which is a subsidary of Huawei Technological Co., Ltd. located in Singapore. I worked as a senior researcher in the project \textit{Software Architecture and Conformance Checking}. In this project, I did a comprehensive research survey on the state-of-the-art practice of R\&D efficiency in Tech Giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, as well as Huawei and its subsidaries. Based on this, I came up with the solutions that solve Huawei's architectural decay issues and developed a prototype that demonstrated the feasiblity. }
\cventry{2020.01~$\sim$2020.10}{Nanyang Technological University}{Research Fellow}{Singapore}{}{I lead the architecture design of a fuzzing service which provides a general-purpose interface for different testing scenarios, such as embedded systems, the automotive-relevant microcontrollers, stateful protocols, etc. I am also involved in a data-based reverse engineering research to help decompose the functional components of a given project.}
\cventry{2019.08~$\sim$~2019.12}{Nanyang Technological University}{Research Associate}{Singapore}{}{I maintain the fuzzing framework FOT. Meanwhile, I am also involved in a high-performance cross-CPU binary fuzzing framework BiFF, as well as a fuzzing technique called MUZZ that aims to boost fuzz testing on multithreaded programs. }
\cventry{2018.09~$\sim$~2019.05}{Scantist}{Research Intern}{Singapore}{}{I co-designed and built the prototype of a cross-CPU grey-box fuzzer for binaries. The CPU instruction sets include ARM (32/64) and RISC-V (32).}
\cventry{2014.05~$\sim$~2015.08}{Nanyang Technological University}{Research Associate}{Singapore}{}{I focused on LLVM-based data flow analysis which aims to improve the dynamic fuzzing effectiveness with the aid of static analysis.}
\cventry{2013.02~$\sim$~2013.11}{Microsoft Research Asia}{Research Intern}{China}{}{I focused on improving the white-box fuzzing technique on patching programs with the help of static analysis; I implemented a static analysis tool that can slice the underlying program for subsequent white-box testing.}

\section{Research Projects}
\cvline{FOT}{2017.07~$\sim$~present\quad I develop and maintain the grey-box fuzzing framework FOT (Fuzzing Orchestration Toolkit). This framework facilitates static analysis to improve overall fuzzing effectiveness. FOT has integrated several existing and we have proposed new fuzzing techniques based on it.\\
\cvlistitem{Project site:\quad\url{https://sites.google.com/view/fot-the-fuzzer}.}
\cvlistitem{FOT has been successfully detecting \textbf{300+ vulnerabilities} in 120+ open source projects such as ffmpeg, glibc, libjpeg-turbo. Among the detected zero-day vulnerabilities, \textbf{61 CVEs} have been assigned, including 10 with critical or high severity according to CVSS3.0. The vulnerability details are available at \url{https://github.com/ntu-sec/pocs}.}
\cvlistitem{
FOT received 1st award in NASAC 2017 prototype competition (fixed topic) and was accepted by ESEC/FSE 2018; Another two fuzzing techniques based on FOT, Hawkeye and Cerebro, were accepted by CCS 2018 and ESEC/FSE 2019 respectively.}
}
\cvline{BiFF}{2018.11~$\sim$~present\quad I am involved in the development of high-performance cross-CPU binary fuzzing framework BiFF, which aims to improve the existing binary-only fuzzing techniques. BiFF facilitates our self-designed hooking technique and optimizes the fuzzing flow for service-like applications, and boosts overall performance of fuzzing against IoT devices with different CPU architectures. BiFF received 1st award in NASAC 2019 prototype competition (freestyle).}
\cvline{Hawkeye}{2017.12~$\sim$~2018.05\quad I designed the directed grey-box fuzzing technique Hawkeye, proposed the four properties a directed fuzzer is supposed to possess and provided our solutions; we experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of Hawkeye. This work was accepted by CCS 2018.}
\cvline{STAndroid}{2015.08~$\sim$~2017.06\quad This project was inspired by the Android permission mechanism and we apply a secure type system to stress a category of information security problems. I designed the type system and proved the soundness. I implemented a checking tool to detect information leakage based on this type system. This work was accepted by CSF 2018.}
\cvline{RBScope}{2013.02~$\sim$~2013.11\quad This project aimed to apply static analysis to improve the effectiveness of the white-box fuzzing. The idea is to prune irrelevant program segments to reduce the search space of the symbolic execution testing technique. I implemented the program slicing based on LLVM framework.}
